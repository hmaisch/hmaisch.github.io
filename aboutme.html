    <div class="description">
        <p>My name is Haley Maisch and I am currently studying 
        Graphic Design at Kansas State University. I first became
        interested in the art of graphic design during my junior 
        year of high school and since then, I have gained such an 
        appreciation for all things design-related. I am the type
        of person who thinks and communicates better visually, and
        I feel that design and art in general can be used to communicate
        with others in ways that sometimes, words can't accomplish. On
        this site, you'll find some of the work I've completed here at KSU
        over the last couple of years, as well as links to my social media.
        I love learning about and creating with people, so free to reach out 
        if you ever want to collaborate or even just need a friend to chat with!</p>
