            <div class="description">
                My name is Haley Maisch and I am currently studying 
                Graphic Design at Kansas State University. I first became
                interested in the art of graphic design during my junior 
                year of high school and since then, I have gained such an 
                appreciation for all things design-related. I am the type
                of person who thinks and communicates better visually, and
                I feel that design and art in general can be used to communicate
                with others in ways that sometimes, words can't accomplish. On
                this site, you'll find some of the work I've completed here at KSU
                over the last couple of years, as well as links to my social media.
                I love learning about and creating with people, so free to reach out 
                if you ever want to collaborate or even just need a friend to chat with!
