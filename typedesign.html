                    Three Event Posters

                <div class="description">
                    This project required us to take the information that was given to 
                    use about the three events, and create a poster for each event that 
                    were visually cohesive, yet still individual to each specific event.   
                    By using similar shapes, and layouts, but differing colors and typefaces, 
                    I created three unique posters that still fit together.

                    Researched Typeface

                <div class="description">
                    For this particular project, we took what we learned from a group research 
                    paper over this particular typeface, and then created a poster that best explained 
                    the typeface that included the name of the typeface, the alphabet and numbers, 
                    and an extra visual piece.  I chose to use the lowercase letter ‘g’ as an anchoring 
                    point of the design because it’s the first letter of the name of the typeface, and 
                    let the rest of the information on the poster flow from that point.  I chose the dark 
                    blue and light red so that there would be a contrast between colors rather than just 
                    using black text.
